### Sedentary Lifestles and Social Media

Hi, I have a PHD in winning games and I'm here to tell you about the dangers of playing Fortnite. 

Sedentary lifestyles are a major contributor to obseity as shown in studies like this [one](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10593524/). It clearly follows that as Fortnite is a major driver for such behavior that its popularity directly correlates with why childhood obsesity is on the rise. I will conclude this short talk with a tangent on the dangers of other applications that are closely related to games, in this case social media such as TikTok. The attention grabbing videos that users are constantly bombarded with cause kids to constantly context switch while they attempt to work on tasks that require their full concentration, such as writing an essay. The non-stop gratification is merely another attempt by businesses to control facets of a persons life. Uninstalling TikTok will not only decrease your weight but also increase your average assignemnt grade by a couple of basis points.
